/* Quinn Keenan, 301504914, 19/09/2025
Ideally, I would have some sort of large question bank (as a file) to deserialize and populate
a list with (or even better, a Java-related, multiple-choice question API I could fetch data
from). However, at the moment, I am not familiar enough with Java to fetch data from APIs at
my current skill level, I am unsure of whether a sufficient API even exists, and I don't have
time to implement serialization for this sprint. Time will tell what improvements I can
realistically make! */
